			<p> The Red Hot Chilipeppers (RHCP) are an American Punk Rock/Funk Band started in 1983 in Los Angeles. Currently the band is made up of lead singer Anthony Keidis, bass guitarist Flea, drummer Chad Smith, and lead guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. The Peppers have always had a lot of moving parts, however Keidis, Flea, and Chad Smith have been consistently a part of the band in their best albums. RHCP is known as the most popular band in alternative rock radio history with 13 #1 singles. The Red Hot Chillipeppers have already been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and are debatably know as the best Rock band in the last 20 years.

		 <p>The above picture shows the zany and creative band displaying their inner weird selves. The Red Hot Chillipeppers are an incredibly unique and diverse band. Starting in the late 1980's, RHCP revolutionized the music industry composing a combination of punk rock and funk. The band has the ability to make you wanna dance, jump around, and then cry. They send your life into a whirl wind of emotions while still proving the mainstream music critics wrong.</p>
